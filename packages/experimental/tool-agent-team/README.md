# @deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-tool-agent-team

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`dsh-experimental-tool-agent-team` gives the model a team toolset on top of the team domain package: create named teammates, start an isolated first-time-user evaluation, steer messages, see who is available, wait for progress, interrupt a stuck teammate, and manage a shared task board — ten tools in total. A short policy section teaches every member how to coordinate, follow the selected project preset, and exchange verifiable handoffs. Mounting it replaces legacy subagent controls with the same tool names, so a composition that wants both must disable the legacy definitions. It is experimental: excluded from official releases and carries no stability promise.

## Use this package

Add this package on top of `@deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-agent-team` when the model should run a team through tools. Once mounted, every team member — the Lead and each teammate — gets the same ten tools plus a policy paragraph that states its own role and name.

### When to choose it

Choose it when the model should create and coordinate teammates by itself rather than a human driving subagent controls. Avoid it when the legacy global subagent tools with the same names must stay available: the team tools replace them for team members, so a composition that wants both must disable the legacy definitions. The fixed policy creates teammates only when you explicitly ask for a team or teammates, so ordinary tasks never trigger delegation on their own.

### Smallest working example

The smallest addition to an existing composition is the two-package fragment from the [agent-team README](../agent-team/README.md#smallest-working-setup): durable session storage, the team domain package, and this package. The plugin itself takes two optional settings:

```yaml
- id: tool-agent-team
  name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-tool-agent-team'
  config:
    freshProvider: spawn
    forkProvider: fork
```

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `freshProvider` | `spawn` | Provider that starts fresh teammates |
| `forkProvider` | `fork` | Provider that starts fork teammates |

The generated [configuration catalog](../../../docs/config-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-experimental-tool-agent-team) is the exhaustive source for every accepted field and its JSDoc.

Try it by asking the Lead model: "create a teammate named reviewer to check the diff, then send reviewer the change summary". The model calls the creation tool and then the messaging tool.

### What the model can do

The ten tools group into five capabilities:

- **Create a teammate** — `spawn_teammate` takes a name, a description, the initial task, and an optional `explorer`, `builder`, or `reviewer` prompt role; only the Lead can call it.
- **Test as a new user** — `spawn_user_tester` gives a fresh teammate only an application entry and a fixed neutral evaluation task; only the Lead can call it.
- **Send messages** — `send_message` steers a running member at its nearest step boundary, starts an idle member, and cold-resumes an inactive teammate.
- **See and wait** — `list_agents` shows the roster with live status; `wait_agent` waits for the next team change; `interrupt_agent` stops a teammate's current turn (Lead only).
- **Manage the task board** — `team_task_create`, `team_task_list`, `team_task_get`, and `team_task_update` add, browse, read, and update shared tasks.

Any member can message any other member and use the task board; only the Lead creates and interrupts teammates. Task updates keep the domain's owner and revision checks, so an outdated edit is rejected instead of overwriting newer work.

### What success and failure look like

Sending a message succeeds as soon as it is safely stored: the result is `accepted` (delivered now) or `queued` (waiting), and a queued message must not be resent. `wait_agent` returns `noProgress` right away when no other member is running or provisioning, telling the caller to wake a teammate first; otherwise it waits for the next change and the caller re-reads state afterward. Task edits based on an outdated revision are rejected rather than overwriting newer work.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

This section explains the design decisions behind the adapter and points at the code that realizes them; the observable behavior is fully covered in [Use this package](#use-this-package).

### Design philosophy

The adapter is built on three commitments:

- **Scoped, not global.** Every registration lives on the member Agent's own `ctx`; nothing is installed for non-Team subagents or the host.
- **Declared results, compact JSON.** Every tool declares its complete result schema and renders that value as compact JSON, so the compiler checks `execute` against what the model is promised and no result spends tokens on indentation.
- **The domain owns authority.** Tools delegate to `ctx.agentTeams`, which enforces Lead authority and revision checks; the adapter adds no weaker path.

The [Agent Teams Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-08-05-agent-teams.md) owns the model-facing and scoping decisions.

### Source map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) | Plugin entry: config, the fixed policy text, and the ten scoped tool registrations |
| — | No runtime invariant companion is published; the Team service owns durable and authorization relations. |

### Policy and tools

One `team:policy` section on the member scope teaches each member its role, the project preset, evidence-based product discovery, first-time-user evaluation, coordination rules, and a fixed handoff order; the text and ten tool registrations are declared in [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts). Optional Explorer, Builder, and Reviewer presets prefix the delegated task with stable evidence, write-scope, or independent-review behavior. Explorer and Reviewer read-only wording is prompt guidance rather than confinement. A handoff reports outcome, evidence, changed artifacts, verification, unresolved risks, and the recommended next action, and separates observed facts from inference. A user tester has a twelve-tool-call ceiling and stops after one simple retry when the entry is inaccessible; it must not hunt for authentication material or alternate bypasses. The ten tool schemas appear only in Team member scopes, so non-Team subagents keep the default catalog.

### Scoped registration and teardown

`maybeInstall` runs for every live Agent and subscribes to `agent/created`; it skips Agents without Team membership. Disposal of an Agent runs the installed disposer, and plugin HMR disposes every installed scope before reinstall. Each disposer unwinds registrations in reverse order, so a failed install cannot leave a partial scope.

- [Agent Teams subsystem](../../../docs/subsystems/agent-team.md) — durable Team types and service API.
- [Generated tool catalog](../../../docs/tool-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-experimental-tool-agent-team) — every tool schema the model receives.

## Model Experience

### Team policy and tools

#### What the model sees

One stable policy section states the exact Team role/name/id, selected project preset, evidence-based discovery and clean-room user-test guidance, optional teammate role semantics, explicit-delegation requirement, shared-cwd behavior, filesystem stale-version recovery, Bash/formatter/codegen risk, task and write-scope coordination, the handoff order, Steer delivery, the no-retry mailbox rule, and the Lead's duty to wait before answering. The ten Team schemas from `spawn_teammate` through `team_task_update` appear only in Team member scopes.

#### Token effect

Fixed policy and schema cost on every Team member request. Tool calls add compact JSON roster, task, wait, or receipt results. Peer content is retained by the Team domain in the target's history.

#### KV Cache effect

Prefix-stable while the Team plugin generation, configuration, member role/name, and schemas remain unchanged. The per-member identity line differs across Agents. Tool results and peer messages append after the reusable request prefix.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits describe what the policy and tools cannot guarantee for a team. They are current package constraints, not a comparison with other collaboration surfaces.

- **Prompt policy is coordination, not confinement** — it cannot stop Bash or external processes from writing overlapping files.
- **Role presets are behavioral** — Explorer and Reviewer are instructed not to edit, but deployments need provider-level sandboxing when read-only access must be enforced.
- **User-test isolation is informational** — the fresh conversation omits Lead history and the fixed task forbids source inspection, credential hunting, and authentication bypasses, but the teammate still runs in the shared deployment and working directory. The twelve-call budget limits accidental exploration cost; use a sandboxed UI-only provider when technical confinement is required.
- **No autonomous team creation** — ordinary tasks do not trigger delegation unless the user explicitly requests it.
- **No Web controls** — browser roster and task-board presentation is outside this runtime package.
- **Experimental prototype with no stability promise** — the package is private, excluded from official releases, and its schemas change freely while it incubates.
